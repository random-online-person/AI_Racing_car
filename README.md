# AFK-Driver

A python project, with OpenCV and tenserflow libraries. "Get_Data.py" records the screen and keybord inputs. "Train_Model.py" trains the model based on the output files made by "Get_Data.py". "Run_Model.py" this runs the model in real time getting the input from the screen and outputing the key presses in the game.
